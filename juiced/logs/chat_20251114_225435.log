[2025-11-14 22:54:37] <naten530> Cincinatti 
[2025-11-14 22:54:37] <Kraven12> how did this little girl get so chubby in the post appocolypse world?
[2025-11-14 22:54:37] <xTOMSERVOx> Oh, they did some hard science research before writing this script. I can tell
[2025-11-14 22:54:37] <Kraven12> where is she getting all this food?
[2025-11-14 22:54:37] <SqueezeMeCigaretti> Beans. All beans
[2025-11-14 22:54:37] <evapilot> This could be an It's Always Sunny episode. Almost. 
[2025-11-14 22:54:37] <Kraven12> gotta hang around her, shes never going hungry
[2025-11-14 22:54:37] <xTOMSERVOx> This could be an old Dr. Who episode for all we know
[2025-11-14 22:54:37] <evapilot> tru tru
[2025-11-14 22:54:37] <AmbsAce> I think I've realized why I love werewolf movies. They take a lot more effort than zombie or vampire movies, but you don't need to be able to afford a full body suit like bigfoot movies. It's that sweet spot for ambition per dollar
[2025-11-14 22:54:37] <Kraven12> thanks for explaining your science project, scientist woman
